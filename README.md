# RED-ALERT-SYSTEM
FLOOD  CONTROL  PREVENTION SYSTEM WITH IOT 
   Natural disasters happen everywhere in the world, and they can be completely disturbing the human life and the economy of the country.
Economy and growth of any country depend upon the agriculture proper alert forecasting makes the farmer to protect the crop from
flooding.

   One of the major disaster arising in our enviroinment is flood, a huge loss of life and properties occur duinrg flood. Our design is very much useful to monitor the water level variations in rivers,dams, reservoirs and the monitored values are regularly stored in server which is useful to send flood alerts to corresponding authority for proper action and the same can be viewed through application.
     
  This model investigates the use of wireless sensor network (WSN) for monitoring of river and flood conditions. The wireless
sensor network system can also be used for real-time monitoring of water conditions like water flow level. Our design is developed for monitoring flood.
    
    The model also consists of a GSM connection through which a red alert can be predicted and sent to the  authorities in the near zones that will be mostly affected by flood. 
    Differnt levels of water sensors are placed in dam and  approximate speed of dam being filled is measured correspondingly in order to predict and prevent the damages.
    
Domain:IOT,Raspberry pi 
Sensors used:water sensor,GSM module
and other required softwares.
